# About teamstatus.space

[teamstatus.space](https://teamstatus.space/) allows distributed teams to collect status updates and collect them for a sync meeting.

It is made by [Markus Tacker](https://github.com/coderbyheart/), in Norway.

You use *teamstatus.space* to track what you are working on, as it happens. It may be small updates, or big releases.

Status updates are associated to projects, which belong to organizations.

You can invite coworkers to the projects you are working on. They than can also add their own status to the project.

Team members can see status, and add reactions. They are an important tool to share praise ‚≠ê, but also prepare the next sync meeting. Status can be marked as significant üöÄ, so they will be highlighted in the next sync. Or a status can be marked as a question üôã so they can be discussed during the sync.

And when it's time for a sync meeting with your collaborators, you create a new sync which collect all the status updates from the projects your meeting is about, from all the collaborators and a time frame you can specify.

This way you do not have to remember all the big and small things that happened since your last sync with this team; or the other group of stakeholders you only meet every other week.

And since you can share what happened in advance, you can spend your time during the meeting to discuss the highlights and the open question which ensures that everyone's time is used most efficiently.
